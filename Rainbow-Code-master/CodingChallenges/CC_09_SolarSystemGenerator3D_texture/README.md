# Coding Challenge #9: Solar System in Processing - Part 3 (3D textures)

In part 3 of this coding challenge, using Processing, I add texture to the 3D objects created in [part 2](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/challenges/CC_08_SolarSystemGenerator3D). The PShape class and createShape() functions are covered.
