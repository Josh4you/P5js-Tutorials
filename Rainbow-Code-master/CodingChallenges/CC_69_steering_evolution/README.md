  * A new "dynasty" is added to the system automatically when there are no vehicles left. The new dynasty will be based on prev generation championâ€™s DNA. Probability of reproduction also related to a requested minimum health value.
  * Press CTRL to toggle debug on/off.
  * Mouse press for adding new vehicles.
  * Press ALT toggle 'tamagotchi mode' ON/OFF (if ON MousePress + 'F' to add food - MousePress + 'P' to add poison)

  *Improved the reproduction function
  * All vehicles have a sex (male or female)
  *A better description of the reproduce function in readme

   * Game in Processing ([Repository](https://github.com/simon-tiger/Game_SteeringBehaviorsEvolution))
     * I am now highlighting the best one
     * Something moving around with perlin noise adds poison (instead of just adding poison randomly)
     * Hopefully, soon I will make p5.js version
